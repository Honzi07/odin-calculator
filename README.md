### The calculator made for The Odin Project curriculum
[Click for the project description](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator)
- The calculator meets all the criteria stated in the project description.
- The design is similar to an [Adler 81S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator#/media/File:Calculator_Adler_81S.jpg) calculator from the mid-1970s but with some changes to fit the layout.
- I used [css normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) for this project through npm.
